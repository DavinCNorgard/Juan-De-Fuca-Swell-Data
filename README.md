# Juan-De-Fuca-Swell-Data

This project uses raw swell and wind data from the Neah Bay Buoy in the Juan de Fuca straight to display historical surf conditions. As an avid surfer, I use this bouy for forecasting frequently and I wanted a way to visualize previous swell data. 
The Python file, (Data-cleanup.py) contains a function I built with the Pandas module to make the data useable.
The Javascript file uses chart.js to create graphs for the given data.
